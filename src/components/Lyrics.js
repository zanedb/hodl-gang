      [Intro]
      <br/>
      Bitcoin, and things like it, is the equivalent of the red pill
      <br/>
      This is a technology, it's a computing language, and I can build an app on it
      <br/>
      Is Bitcoin the currency of the future?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      [Chorus x2]
      <br/>
      Crypto gang
      <br/>
      Ether gang
      <br/>
      Bit gang
      <br/>
      Alt gang
      <br/>
      Lite gang
      <br/>
      Cash game
      <br/>
      Blockchain (woah)
      <br/>

      <br/>
      Haters wanna say I'm in a bubble man! (blow)
      <br/>

      [Verse 1: Chris Record]
      <br/>
      Ethereum pays for my rent (boss)
      <br/>
      Bitcoin pays for the Bent (skirt)
      <br/>
      Litecoin pays for the jet (fleet)
      <br/>
      Bitcoin Cash for the rest (blast)
      <br/>
      Spend 30 racks on an ICO, what coin did you buy? I forgot yo!
      <br/>
      Just got started last night bro, and I'm already hooked like a pipe though
      <br/>
      Flippin the coin, making it grow, taking it slow, letting it go, cashflow's growing it's incredible to watch it flow
      <br/>
      Stackin the cash, taking it home, making it fast, I'm on a roll, a little bit mo' is all I ask for the bubble though
      <br/>
      Currently, learning 'bout a new type of currency
      <br/>
      Burning the dollar down like an emergency, urgently listen my friends have been urging me, coins have been surging we earning like surgeons see
      <br/>
      We on a mission man, cryptomaniacs, act like you don't really know about us? Stop that!
      <br/>
      Bitcoin blowing up like a bomb, step back! Used to be a couple hundred dollars, should a copped that!
      <br/>
      Blew up on a scene from the mind of a brainiac, back in 2009, where the miners at?
      <br/>
      Silk road baby, it's gotta be anonymous (skirt)
      <br/>
      Satoshi blew up now we on the map! (yea)
      <br/>
      <br/>

      <br/>

      <br/>

      [Outro]
      <br/>
      It is the most powerful technology that the world has seen, I believe, since the invention of agriculture
      <br/>
      Bitcoin is exciting because it shows how cheap it can be
      <br/>
      Bitcoin is, better than currency
      <br/>
      As with most major technology shifts, let's think about what young people are doing
      <br/>
      32% of young people say they prefer Bitcoin to stocks
      <br/>
      42% of millennial males say they plan to purchase Bitcoin in the next 5 years
      <br/>
      We're barely in the first inning right now
      <br/>
