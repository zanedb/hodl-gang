      [Intro]
      Bitcoin, and things like it, is the equivalent of the red pill
      This is a technology, it's a computing language, and I can build an app on it
      Is Bitcoin the currency of the future?

      [Chorus x2]
      Crypto gang
      Ether gang
      Bit gang
      Alt gang
      Lite gang
      Cash game
      Blockchain (woah)
      I don't really ever buy stocks man (nope)
      Haters wanna say I'm in a bubble man! (blow)
      Ch-chew em up like bubble gum (dope)
      Just made a mil with my pocket change (yo)
      Record bout to go and join the hodl gang (oh)
      HODL GANG, HODL GANG, HODL GANG

      [Verse 1: Chris Record]
      Ethereum pays for my rent (boss)
      Bitcoin pays for the Bent (skirt)
      Litecoin pays for the jet (fleet)
      Bitcoin Cash for the rest (blast)
      Spend 30 racks on an ICO, what coin did you buy? I forgot yo!
      Just got started last night bro, and I'm already hooked like a pipe though!
      Flippin the coin, making it grow, taking it slow, letting it go, cashflow's growing it's incredible to watch it flow
      Stackin the cash, taking it home, making it fast, I'm on a roll, a little bit mo' is all I ask for the bubble though
      Currently, learning 'bout a new type of currency
      Burning the dollar down like an emergency, urgently listen my friends have been urging me, coins have been surging we earning like surgeons see
      We on a mission man, cryptomaniacs, act like you don't really know about us? Stop that!
      Bitcoin blowing up like a bomb, step back! Used to be a couple hundred dollars, should a copped that!
      Blew up on a scene from the mind of a brainiac, back in 2009, where the miners at?
      Silk road baby, it's gotta be anonymous (skirt)
      Satoshi blew up now we on the map! (yea)

      [Chorus]
      Crypto gang
      Ether gang
      Bit gang
      Alt gang
      Lite gang
      Cash game
      Blockchain (woah)
      I don't really ever buy stocks man (nope)
      Haters wanna say I'm in a bubble man! (blow)
      Ch-chew em up like bubble gum (dope)
      Just made a mil with my pocket change (yo)
      Record bout to go and join the hodl gang (oh)
      HODL GANG, HODL GANG, HODL GANG

      [Verse 2: Chris Record]
      Everybody looking at me now and they shocked now 'cuz the price going down, meanwhile...
      I'm a cop more at a discount, with a smile, cuz I'm making money on the Alt coins right now!
      I'm a double down like animal style (sup now)
      People in the crowd they watching me bubble up now
      Open up a brand new Coinbase account and I'm buying everything from Ripple to Litecoin now!
      Pull out my principal keep it real simple then play with the house (facts)
      Investing in crypto, I'm chasing these coins like they cheese to a mouse (mouse)
      I'm on the verge of a digital currency merging technologies this is the future so obviously I'm all in, there's no bottom we #hodling now!

      [Chorus]
      HODL GANG, HODL GANG, HODL GANG, HODL GANG, HODL GANG, HODL GANG, HODL GANG
      Throw your hands in the air man (fly)
      If you’re d-down with the blockchain (bbbrrrrr)
      I ain’t got time for the haters man (no)
      We about to grow to a million (grow)
      HODL GANG, HODL GANG, HODL GANG (ohhhh)
      Tell me, are you down with the crypto?
      HODL GANG, HODL GANG, HODL GANG, HODL GANG, HODL GANG, HODL GANG, HODL GANG
      Throw your hands in the air man (fly)
      If you’re d-down with the blockchain (bbbrrrrr)
      I ain’t got time for the haters man (no)
      We about to grow to a million (grow)
      HODL GANG, HODL GANG, HODL GANG (ohhhh)
      Tell me, are you down with the crypto?

      [Outro]
      It is the most powerful technology that the world has seen, I believe, since the invention of agriculture
      Bitcoin is exciting because it shows how cheap it can be
      Bitcoin is, better than currency
      As with most major technology shifts, let's think about what young people are doing
      32% of young people say they prefer Bitcoin to stocks
      42% of millennial males say they plan to purchase Bitcoin in the next 5 years
      We're barely in the first inning right now
